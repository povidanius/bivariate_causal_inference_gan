# bivariate_causal_inference_gan

This repository contains generator (gen.py) and discriminator (disc.py) modules for bivariate causal inference modelling.

## Generator

Generator from gaussian noise generates as set of samples$ $ y = f(x) + \epsilon$, where noise $\epsilon$ is independent of $x$, and $f(.)$ is piecewise linear, monotonous function.
